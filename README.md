In this repository you will find simulink files to simulate 3 phase 4 wire system
This repository consists of simulink file for measurement of neutral wire current in 3phase 4 wire system 
File name system1 represents domestic loads of about 2.5-5kW distributed almost uniformly among 3 phases
File name system2 consists of the same system as system 1 but has added PV generation capabilities to few loads on a single phase 
file name system3 consists of the system same as system 2 but the PV generation is distributed among 3 phases as supposed to single phase in system2.
The neutral wire current increses in system2 where PV generation is not distributed among the 3 phases but the neutral wire current decreses in system3 where PV generation is distributed among 3 phases.
